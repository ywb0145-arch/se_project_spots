# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- "Spots" is an image-sharing social media website project that allows its users to input their own images and descriptions. HTML, CSS and Figma were utilized in building this project.
- Figma was utilzed to help build the website from scratch. It was also used to gather the test images and descriptions until users input their own images and descriptions.
- Images gathered for the project were from Figma with proper dimensions and styles implemented to replicate the final result that was given on Figma.
